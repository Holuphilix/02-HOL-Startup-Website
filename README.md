# Basic Git Commands

In this mini Project, I will create a step-by-step project to simulate the workflow of Tom and Jerry using Git and GitHub. This hands-on project will include installation of Git, setting up a GitHub respository, cloning the repository, creating branches, making changes, and merging those changes back into the main branch

### Part 1: Setup and Intial Configuration

#### 1. Install Git:
- Visit the official Git Webisite (https://git-scm.com/downloads) and download the version of Git for your operating system. Follow the installation instruction.

#### 2. Create a GitHub Repository

- Sign up or log in to GitHub
   
- Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository."

- Name your repository (HOL-Startup-Website) and initialize it with a README file.
  
![Name and README.md File](./Img/Repos_Name.png)
- "Create repository"

  #### 3. Clone the Repository

- On your repository's page on GitHub, click the "Code" button and copy the HTTPS URL.
  
  ![Git Clone URL](./Img/Git%20clone.png)


- Open your Git bash terminal or command Prompt
  
- Create a folder named "DAREY.IO_PROJECTS related work

- Change directory into the "DAREY.IO_PROJECT"
  
- Clone (Download) the repository from using 

###### Git clone [Past the URL copied from GitHub]

![Git cloned page](./Img/github_cloned.png)

#### Part 1

- Navigate to HOL-Startup-Website
- Create a empty file "index.html"

![Navigate to HOL-Startup and create file](./Img/Navigate_create_file.png)


- Add the content "This is the Admin creating an index.html file for jerry
- Check changes has not been staged
- Git add index.html

![Git status, add](./Img/git_add.png)

- Commit changes 
- Push main branch to Github
  
![commit and Push main](./Img/Git_commit_push.png)

### Part 2: Simulating Tom and Jerry's Work

1. Tom's Work
- Navigate to the project directory you just cloned
- Git branch
- Git checkout -b update-navigation 

![Git branch, checkout](./Img/new_branch.png)

- Add the content below
- Check changes has not been staged
- Status Tom's changes
- Confirm changes have been stagged for commit.

![Add the content, staged](./Img/git_add_content_stages.png)

- Git add Tom's changes
  ![git add index](./Img/update_git_add.png)

- Commit Tom's changes
- Git push origin to GitHub

![commit and push](./Img/Git_commit_push.png)

After completing Tom's workflow, you will now simulate jerry's contribution to the project. To do this, you'll

- switch back to the main branch 
- create a new branch for jerry
- make changes, and then
- stage, commit, and push these changes to GitHub.



1. Jerry's Work:
- Switch Back to the Main Branch:
![switch to main branch](./Img/change%20branch.png)

- Create a New Branch for Jerry's Work
- Open index.html and Add contact Information: Make your changes to the index.html file by add contact Information. This simulates jerry's task.
- Stage Jerry's changes:
- Commit Jerry's changes:

![New,add,stage,commit](./Img/git_add_content_stages.png)


- Push Jerry's Branch to GitHub:
  
![push](./Img/push_add_info.png)

This command uploads Jerry's branch to the Github respository, making it available for review and merging into the main project.
